urgent clean up TODOs so that the C library is fully usable:
- make install target for the library
- introduce library version
- pkg-config for the library
- fix missing function documentation in pubnub.h

afterwards:
- factor out libpubnub-event.so so that libevent is not hard dep for libpubnub
- make some RPi examples integrating the C e.g. with WiringPi
- add README.md with general description
- build C++ wrapper

later?
- way to configure NOSIGNAL curl mode
- standardized timeout handling (configurable)
- standardized error retry policy (configurable)
- more demo's?
- some unit tests?
- SSL support?
