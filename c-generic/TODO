urgent clean up TODOs so that the C library is fully usable:
- move examples to separate directories
- build examples to be executable against locally built library
	(now, running them requires setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.)
- make install target for the library
- introduce library version
- pkg-config for the library

afterwards:
- factor out libpubnub-event.so so that libevent is not hard dep for libpubnub
- build C++ wrapper
- fix missing function documentation in pubnub.h
- add README.md with general description
- make some RPi examples integrating the C/C++ e.g. with WiringPi

later?
- way to configure NOSIGNAL curl mode
- standardized timeout handling (configurable)
- standardized error retry policy (configurable)
- more demo's?
- some unit tests?
- SSL support?
